## Webhook Relay (Transponder)

Webhook Relay allows anyone to receive, transform webhooks and expose web services to the internet without having public IP or configuring NAT/firewall in a secure way.

Transponder is a self-hosted, stripped down Webhook Relay server that can:
* Forward webhooks to internal destinations
* Open bidirectional tunnels to expose internal services to the internet
